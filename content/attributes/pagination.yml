  total_count:
    description: |-
      One greater than the offset of the last entry in the entire collection.
      The total number of entries in the collection may be less than
      `total_count`.

      This field is only returned for calls that use offset-based pagination.
      For marker-based paginated APIs, this field will be omitted.
    example: 5000
    type: integer
    format: int64

  limit:
    description: |-
      The limit that was used for these entries. This will be the same as the
      `limit` query parameter unless that value exceeded the maximum value
      allowed. The maximum value varies by API.
    example: 1000
    type: integer
    format: int64

  offset:
    description: |-
      The 0-based offset of the first entry in this set. This will be the same
      as the `offset` query parameter.

      This field is only returned for calls that use offset-based pagination.
      For marker-based paginated APIs, this field will be omitted.
    example: 2000
    type: integer
    format: int64

  order:
    description: |-
      The order by which items are returned.

      This field is only returned for calls that use offset-based pagination.
      For marker-based paginated APIs, this field will be omitted.
